The swipebar component is a visual indicator for an area that has horizontal overflow. This is especially helpful to interact with large content like tables on mobile devices. See table component for more examples.

Use with care as this is not a replacement for propper responsive layout but to handle edge cases!

### Basic

The swipebar can be used to wrap any element and will be displayed instead of the native scrollbar.

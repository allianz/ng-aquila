### Module

Ensure that you provide a date implementation in addition to the required module:

```ts
import { NxDatefieldModule } from '@aposin/ng-aquila/datefield';
import { NxNativeDateModule } from '@aposin/ng-aquila/datefield';
```

The date field requires the Angular CDK (incl. CSS). Learn [how to enable Angular CDK styles](./documentation/overlay/overview#angular-cdk).

### Choose your DateAdapter

You can choose between using the native date, an ISO string adapter that uses [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) under the hood, [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), or implement your own. This documentation is using the moment date adapter.

| Module | Date type | Supported locales | Dependencies | Import from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NxNativeDateModule` | `Date` | en-US | None | `@aposin/ng-aquila/datefield` |
| `NxMomentDateModule` | `Moment` | [See moment project](https://github.com/moment/moment/tree/develop/src/locale) | [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) | `@aposin/ng-aquila/moment-date-adapter` |
| `NxIsoDateModule` | `string` in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD | [See dayjs project](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/tree/dev/src/locale) | [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) | `@aposin/ng-aquila/iso-date-adapter` |

Momentjs ships with every locale thus significantly increasing the bundle size. The iso date adapter uses dayjs where you have to import the locales you want to support manually. So you are under control and have huge potential bundle size savings. With en and de locales you save around 300KB (pre gzip).

#### ISO Date Adapter

The ISO date adapter works solely with YYYY-MM-DD strings. Under the hood it uses dayjs to support formatting, parsing and localization. With this adapter you don't have to create a proper Date, Dayjs or Moment Object first to bind it with ngModel or reactive forms.

```ts
import { NxIsoDateModule } from '@aposin/ng-aquila/iso-date-adapter';
```

#### Native Date

```ts
import { NxNativeDateModule } from '@aposin/ng-aquila/datefield';
```

That's an implementation on top of the native Date object in the browser. You have no dependencies but you won't be able to change the parse format. To repeat this: You won't be able to change the parsing, that's why for most use cases you should use the ISO or moment adapter.

#### Moment.js

```ts
import { NxMomentDateModule } from '@aposin/ng-aquila/moment-date-adapter';
```

If you choose to use the moment implementation you have to fulfill the Moment.js peerDependency and import the NxMomentDateModule instead of the NativeDateAdapter.

#### Custom

You can implement your own DateAdapter to use other libraries like [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) or [fecha](https://github.com/taylorhakes/fecha).

#### Setting the selected date

The type of values that the datepicker expects depends on the type of DateAdapter provided in your application. The `NativeDateAdapter`, for example, works directly with **plain JavaScript Date objects**. When using the `MomentDateAdapter`, however, the **values will all be Moment.js instances**. With the `IsoDateAdapter` the model is ISO date strings in the format of YYYY-MM-DD.

Depending on the DateAdapter being used, the datepicker may automatically deserialize certain date formats for you as well. For example, both the `NativeDateAdapter` and `MomentDateAdapter` allow [ISO 8601](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) strings to be passed to the datepicker and automatically converted to the proper object type. This can be convenient when binding data directly from your backend to the datepicker. However, the datepicker will not accept date strings formatted in user format such as "1/2/2017" as this is ambiguous and will mean different things depending on the locale of the browser running the code. You can test which strings are accepted:

<!-- example(datefield-iso) -->

### Manipulating dates

The adapter interface defines some methods to directly manipulate a date value like `addCalendarDays`, `addCalendarMonths` and `addCalendarYears`. That way you don't need to know how the underlying date object works and especially helps for the Iso Date Adapter to manipulate your date. See the [API](./documentation/datefield/overview) for a list of methods.

### Examples

This is a full example showing the capabilities of this component. It integrates into `nx-formfield` so you have access to floating labels, hints and error messages. Optionally you can provide a Datepicker.

You need to add the Directives `nxInput` to make the input accessible to the `nx-formfield` and `nxDatefield` to gain access to the actual date handling. The datepicker is provided by creating the `nx-datepicker` component together with a `nx-datepicker-toggle`. You have to tell the date field about the datepicker by connecting it with the `[nxDatepicker]` Input.

<!-- example(datefield-basic) -->

#### Disabled

You can disable the input as usually. The datepicker toggle will be disabled too.

<!-- example(datefield-disabled) -->

#### Min & Max

You can define a range of valid dates with min and max. The given limits are reflected in the datepicker too. If the user manage to input invalid dates you will get the errors `nxDatefieldMax`, `nxDatefieldMin` and `nxDatefieldParse` in your form model.

<!-- example(datefield-min-max) -->

#### Date Filter

Instead of using min/max you can use `nxDatefieldFilter` to create your own set of valid dates. This example only allows the 6th day of each month. The datepicker disables all invalid dates. Validation will give you an error in the field `nxDatefieldFilter`.

<!-- example(datefield-filter) -->

#### Today Button

You can enable the Today button by setting `showTodayButton` to `true`. Clicking this button will navigate the calendar to the current month, but it won’t select the current date. 
We suggest not showing the Today button when today’s date cannot be displayed on the screen (e.g. due to minDate, maxDate, or dateFilter), as it may cause confusion.

<!-- example(datefield-today-button) -->

#### Reactive form

<!-- example(datefield-reactive) -->

#### Readonly

<!-- example(datefield-readonly) -->

### Date Range

#### Plain and with Datepicker

To create a date range, you can open the datepicker for the end date automatically when a start date is selected.

<!-- example(datefield-range) -->

#### Date Range validation

It's possible to validate date ranges. As default the component will return
- `nxDateRangeInvalid` if the start date is after the end date
- `nxDateRangeIncomplete` if the date range is set only partially

additionally the following validations can be configured
- `min` will check if the start date is >= `min` date and will return `nxDatefieldMin` if does not match
- `max` will check if the start date is <= `max` date and will return `nxDatefieldMax` if does not match
- `filter` will check if the start and and date matches the filter and will return `nxDateRangeStartFilter` and `nxDateRangeEndFilter` respectively
- `required` will check if a complete value is present, will return a `required` validation error otherwise

<!-- example(datefield-range-validation) -->

#### Range Parsing & Formatting

You can make use of same functionality as with the regular [Datefield parsing & formatting](documentation/datefield/overview#parsing-%2526-formatting).
This example will except and parse inputs of `MM/DD/YYYY | MM--DD-->YYYY | MMDDYYY | 'MMMM DD, YYYY'`. So <i>03032020</i> is a valid input.

<!-- example(datefield-range-format) -->


### Parsing & Formatting

Both parsing and formatting depend on the capabilities of the chosen DateAdapter. Every date adapter brings it's own defaults so you don't have to set anything by default. To do so anyway you inject the necessary patterns through the injection token `NX_DATE_FORMATS`:

<!-- example(datefield-format-injection) -->

#### Parsing

Parsing converts the input string to the proper model of the date adapter you are using.

**Parsing capabilities of date adapters:** The native date object has only minimal parsing capabilities. There is no parsing format supported so it's simply ignored if any is given.

The default parsing pattern for the Iso and moment adapter is `L` standing for local aware and translates to `MM/DD/YYYY` for `en`.

Pass a pattern of your choice to be used for the internal date heuristics. There are multiple valid formats. If you don't pass one, the current locale format will be the base for the pattern's heuristics.

In order to prevent any ambiguity with the date given by the user, **parsing is set to strict by default**. You can disable the strict mode with `[nxStrict]='false'`, but be aware that this may lead to situations where the date is not recognized as intended by the user.

The following example shows two datefields with both strict and non-strict formatting. The `[parseFormat]` is set to MM-DD-YYYY. In your implementation you can also use a list of strings for `[parseFormat]`.

<!-- example(datefield-parsing) -->

#### Formatting

The formatting of the date is not initiated through user input. Therefore, the field will only trigger the formatting step if you enter a new value through the model. The default for the moment adapter is `L` given through display.dateInput. You can override that value by injecting your own `NxDateFormats` object or locally per datepicker with the property `nxDisplayFormat`. Here is an example: Provide a valid input like 01/01/2018, then click somewhere outside of the input field. The recognized date will be written into the model, now forcing a formatting step on `blur`.

You will see a change in format. If this format is not covered by your set of parsing functions, the value won't validate when the user tries to change it. That's why we have two parse formats in place: `['MM/DD/YYYY', 'MM--DD-->YYYY']`

<!-- example(datefield-formatting) -->

### Start View

You can start the datepicker with different views. Use the property `startView` to do so. There are three views: Months (to pick a day, default), Year (to pick a month), MultiYear (to pick a year).

<!-- example(datefield-startview) -->

### Manual Control

You can manually open or close the date picker by accessing its template reference and calling either `open` or `close`.

<!-- example(datefield-manual) -->

### Localization

#### Date Localization

The ability to localize the datepicker **depends on the chosen date implementation**. The native date adapter supports only en-US and you can't change the values. The Iso and moment adapters support a variety of locales.

The Datepicker falls back on the Application token `LOCALE_ID` and can be overwritten through the `NX_DATE_LOCALE` if necessary:

```ts
@NgModule({
    providers: [{ provide: NX_DATE_LOCALE, useValue: 'en-GB' }],
})
export class MyApp {}
```

If you want to **change the locale during runtime** you can use the `setLocale()` method of the used DateAdapter implementation. This is shown in the following example.

**Please note** that the locale setting does not change all labels and texts in the datepicker, only the date related parts are translated. You need to provide your own translation for texts like the header. You can find an example in the next chapter [Localizing labels and messages](./documentation/datefield/overview#localizing-labels-and-messages).

From Angular v.17 each locale needs to be imported separately with moment.js:
```ts
import 'moment/locale/de';
import 'moment/locale/ja';
import 'moment/locale/ar';
```
<!-- example(datefield-localize-date) -->

#### Localizing labels and messages

The different texts and strings in the datepicker (like the button "Choose a date") can be translated by implementing a subclass of `NxDatepickerIntl` and provide it in your (root) module. Here is an example where we changed the default "Choose month and year" text to "Choose button".

**Important**: If you use your own label texts, please make sure that you also provide all the properties that are needed for screen reader users. These are also shown in the following example.

<!-- example(datefield-localize-texts) -->

### Accessibility

The provider `NxDatepickerIntl` contains various strings to provide labels for screen readers. You have to provide a proper translation for each of your locales. See the example in the [Localizing labels and messages](./documentation/datefield/overview#localizing-labels-and-messages) chapter above.

The provider includes a `changes` subject that you can use to notify dependent components about changes of the strings during runtime.

Regarding Keyboard navigation see the following chapter.

### Keyboard Navigation

Each view of the calendar (month, year, multiYear) supports a wide range of key shortcuts. Here is an overview.

#### Keyboard shortcuts

The date field supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut             | Action                                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `ALT` + `DOWN_ARROW` | Open the calendar pop-up (if date field is focused) |
| `ENTER`              | Open the calendar pop-up (if date icon is focused)  |
| `ESCAPE`             | Close the calendar pop-up                           |

In month view:

<div class="docs-expert-container">

#### Expert: Remove focus from datepicker toggle

The datepicker toggle can be focused via keyboard navigation (by pressing `TAB`). For expert this can be switched off with setting `[tabindex]="-1"` on `<nx-datepicker-toggle/>`, so that only the input field is focusable. The calendar can still be opened by clicking on the calendar icon or by pressing `ALT` + `DOWN_ARROW`.

<!-- example(datefield-toggle-focus) -->

</div>

### Global Settings

You can use the `DATEPICKER_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` injection token if you want to set `[tabindex]` property on `<nx-datepicker-toggle>` component globally. Using `DATEPICKER_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` you can set `toggleIconTabindex` property that modifies `tabindex`.

<!-- example(datefield-injection-token) -->

If you want to use a custom scroll strategy, you can use the `NX_DATEPICKER_SCROLL_STRATEGY` injection token with a factory provider. The `Overlay` service from `@angular/cdk/overlay` offers 4 different scroll strategy options:

-   **reposition:** allow background scroll, the overlay moves with the background (default).
-   **close:** allow background scroll, closes the overlay on scroll.
-   **block:** disallow background scroll, the overlay does not move.
-   **noop:** allow background scroll, the overlay does not move.

<!-- example(datefield-scroll-strategy-provider) -->

Alternatively, the `NX_DATEPICKER_SCROLL_STRATEGY` injection token can be provided by importing `NxScrollStrategyModule.withConfig({ ... })` into your application or feature module, after your other aquila imports.

## Custom theming - release candidate
All components in this library are styled by using the style tokens listed [here](./documentation/theming/overview#general-theming-tokens). You can create your own custom theme by overwriting the values of these style tokens.

The library provides an interface for extending and overwriting properties of our base theme to enable the creation of custom application themes. This is accomplished by using SCSS maps for merging your newly defined style tokens and our base theme tokens and then injecting those into the components by CSS variables.

### Customizing the base theme
In order to define your custom theme first create a file `<your-theme>.scss`.

To register your theme import the theming utilities:

```scss
@import "@aposin/ng-aquila/styles/theming";
```

Then, you should define your new theme as a `scss-map` which overwrites all default theming tokens you want to change:

```scss
$my-theme: (
  interactive-primary: green,

  link-color: interactive-primary,

  heading-01-font-size: 58px,
  heading-01-line-height: 64px,
  heading-01-font-weight: 500,
  heading-01-letter-spacing: 0.2px
);

$nx-themes: nx-register-theme($my-theme, themeName);
```

By calling the `nx-register-theme(themeName)` mixin you are merging our base theme with your own theme (overwritten tokens + new tokens).

Per default, the base theme for the new theme is aposin. You can also pass another theme as a base (third argument), but you first have to import or define it:

```scss
@import "@aposin/ng-aquila/styles/theming";
@import "@aposin/ng-aquila/styles/themes/your-base-theme";
...
$nx-themes: nx-register-theme($my-theme, themeName, baseThemeName);
```

<div class="docs-private">
Currently the following internal themes are available as a base theme: **aposin** (implicitly), **ndbx**, **ndbx-expert** and **direct**, which have to be explicitly imported as shown in the example above.
</div>

### Enabling (building) a new theme
In order to inject the newly defined custom theme tokens into the components you have to build your new theme by using the `nx-buid-theme` mixin.

```scss
@include nx-build-theme(themeName);
```

**Important:** Keep in mind the theme building should happen after you have registered your custom theme and preferably only once in the whole application.
We recommend the following import in your global scss file:
```scss
@import "@aposin/ng-aquila/styles/theming";
@import "<path-to-theme-file>/<your-theme>.scss";

@include nx-build-theme(themeName);
```

### Using your new theme
In order to have access to the newly defined tokens you have to import `<your-theme>.scss` into every SCSS file where you want to use your tokens. You can also import it to a global SCSS stylesheet and import this one wherever needed.

We provide you with two utility helpers:
* **nx-theme(token)** for getting a css variable value
* **type-style(token)** for getting the defined typography properties of an element. here you have to prefix these tokens in the same way and define font-size, font-weight, letter-spacing and line-height as shown in the snippet with *headline-01* above.

```scss
@import "<path-to-theme-file>/<your-theme>.scss";

.test-class {
  @include type-style(heading-01);
  background: nx-theme(interactive-primary);
}
```

### Advanced
You can also add new tokens when creating your custom theme as well as use exisiting token values for your new tokens:

```scss
$my-theme: (
  my-new-token: pink,
  my-new-token-2: primary-action,
);

$nx-themes: nx-register-theme($my-theme, themeName);
```

And then use them as stated before:
```scss
@import "<path-to-theme-file>/<your-theme>.scss";

.test-class {
  background: nx-theme(my-new-token);
}
```

### General Theming Tokens

Our components are themed by the following general tokens. You can overwrite their values in your custom theme.
A full list of the current style tokens can be found [here](https://www.github.com/aposin/ng-aquila/blob/main/projects/ng-aquila/src/shared-styles/theming/tokens.scss).

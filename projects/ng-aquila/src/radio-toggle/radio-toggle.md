### Basic

Important: If you use only icons or anything else that is not descriptive enough for screen readers, make sure to set a
descriptive `ariaLabel`.

### Template-driven form with ngModel

<!-- example(radio-toggle-form) -->

### Reactive form

When using reactive forms you have to disable the control with the form control and not the `disabled` property!

### Validation

Below you can find an example with a custom validator, which accepts only `B` as a correct option.

<!-- example(radio-toggle-validation) -->

### Accessibility

If you use only icons or anything else that is not descriptive enough for screen readers, make sure to set a descriptive
`ariaLabel` <a href="documentation/radio-toggle/overview#custom">as shown in the _Custom_ Toggle Buttons example</a>.

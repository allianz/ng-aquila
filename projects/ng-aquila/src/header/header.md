The header is placed at the top of your application and can have one or two rows. It usually contains a brand logo, navigation links and other actions like a user profile.

The header provides a layout consisting of three sections, `<nx-header-brand>`, `<nx-header-navigation>` and `<nx-header-actions>`. The `<nx-header-brand>` is the first section from the left and contains the applications/brands logo.

Next there is a `<nx-header-navigation>` section that can contain navigation links. The styling of the individual navigation links is provided by the `nxHeaderLink` directive.

The last section is the `<nx-header-actions>` which can contain any other actions like a user profile popover.

### Basic header

<!-- example(header) -->

### Multiple rows

In some cases you want to have a header with two rows. In this case simply place another `<nx-header-row>` element after the first one.

```html
<header nx-header>
    <nx-header-row> First row </nx-header-row>
    <nx-header-row> Second row </nx-header-row>
</header>
```
<!-- example(header-two-rows) -->

#### Application title and Header Actions

You can show the title of your application in the header by using the `<nx-header-app-title>` directive inside the `<nx-header-brand>` as shown in the example below. The application title is displayed after the logo separated by a vertical line.

`<nx-header-actions>` is a container where additional actions can be placed. Depending on the action, use links if it redirects to a different page, or a button if it is an action happening on the current page.

<!-- example(header-icons) -->

#### Co-branding

A co-branding can be used in the header. It is positioned in the rightmost position separated by a vertical line. The `<nx-header-actions>` directive supports showing a left vertical separation line by setting the property `showSeparator=true`.

<!-- example(header-cobranding) -->
</div>

### Responsive

You can make header responsive by using `NxViewportService` to detect the screen size. Here are some examples:

#### Header Icons
An example of a responsive header where multiple icons transform into a burger menu button on smaller screens. Click to view in fullscreen and resize the screen to see it in action.

<!-- example(header-icons-responsive) -->

#### Header two rows

An example of a responsive two-row header that integrates with the `<nx-menu>` component. On smaller screens, the second row collapses into a single row, and header actions are moved into a burger menu button. Click to view in fullscreen and resize the screen to see it in action.

<!-- example(header-two-rows-responsive) -->

#### Header with Side Navigation

An example of a header integrated with `<nx-sidebar>`, where its options move into the sidebar menu on smaller screens. Click to view in fullscreen and resize the screen to see it in action.

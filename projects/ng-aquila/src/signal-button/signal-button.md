The signal button can be used to open a popover with a message. With use of `popoverDirection` the popover can be opened in the direction `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right`. The popover `scrollStrategy` can be set to `close` or `reposition`.

### Context

The `context` is set to `success` per default, but the signal button can also be used with context `error` or `warning`.

<!-- example(signal-button-context) -->

### Disabled

With `disabled` the signal button can be disabled.

<!-- example(signal-button-disabled) -->

### Accessibility

When using the `nx-signal-button` please set a suitable `aria-label` for it.

Copytext is implemented as a component which can be used optionally. Instead of applying the full set of BEM classes like `c-copy c-copy--medium` to a paragraph, you can use this component by directly passing the size property.

### Sizes

<!-- example(copytext-sizes) -->

### Negative styling

<!-- example(copytext-negative) -->

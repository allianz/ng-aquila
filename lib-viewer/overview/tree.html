<p class="docs-markdown--p">The nx-tree provides a tree that can be used to display hierarchy data. This component is designed to work in conjunction with the <a href="./documentation/sidebar/overview">sidebar</a>. It is heavily inspired my the Angular Material Flat Tree. For an in depth documentation see <a href="https://material.angular.io/components/tree/overview">material.angular.io</a>.</p>
<p class="docs-markdown--p">A <code>&lt;nx-tree&gt;</code> is a flat tree consisting of <code>&lt;nx-tree-node&gt;</code> nodes.</p>
<div nx-docs-example="tree" config="{}">exampleID: tree</div>
<h3 id="adding-expand%2Fcollapse" tabindex="-1" class="docs-markdown--h3">Adding expand/collapse</h3>
<p class="docs-markdown--p">The <code>nxTreeNodeToggle</code> directive can be used to add expand/collapse feature to the tree node. It can be added to any place on the tree node. For better accessibility this directive should be added on a <code>button</code> element.</p>
<h3 id="tree-with-checkboxes-using-the-cdk" tabindex="-1" class="docs-markdown--h3">Tree with checkboxes using the CDK</h3>
<p class="docs-markdown--p">The tree component was initially designed mostly for navigation purposes and simple structured data. If you need a tree with checkboxes or other interactive elements, we suggest using the Angular CDK tree. For more information on the CDK tree, see the <a href="https://material.angular.io/cdk/tree/overview">Angular CDK documentation</a>.
The following example shows how to use the CDK tree with checkboxes and how to style it according to design guidelines.</p>
<div nx-docs-example="tree-with-checkboxes" config="{}">exampleID: tree-with-checkboxes</div>
<h3 id="accessibility" tabindex="-1" class="docs-markdown--h3">Accessibility</h3>
<p class="docs-markdown--p">To provide an accessible tree, the expandable nodes need to contain a <code>button</code> element. Similar to this the leaf nodes need to contain a valid <code>a</code> or <code>button</code> element. The tree can then be traversed by keyboard. You can <code>TAB</code> into the tree and go through the individual nodes with <code>UP</code> and <code>DOWN</code> buttons. You can close/expand them by pressing <code>LEFT</code> and <code>RIGHT</code> buttons respectively or toggle with <code>ENTER</code> or <code>SPACE</code>.</p>
<p class="docs-markdown--p">To enable better keyboard support any actionable element (<code>a</code>, <code>button</code>, etc.) within a node needs to have <code>nxTreeNodeActionItem</code> directive set on it. This way when navigating through the tree, the focus state is correctly passed to the actionable item.</p>
<p class="docs-markdown--p">This approach has some limitations, since we are using native DOM <code>focus</code> method to pass the focus state to the element. More complex components, like <code>nx-checkbox</code> for example, will not pick it up as expected, since the actual input is nested deep within the component and you can not attach the <code>nxTreeNodeActionItem</code> to it.</p>
